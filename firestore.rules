/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Tourific application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model.  Each user can only
 * access their own profile data and the search queries associated with their profile.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Search queries for a user are stored under `/users/{userId}/search_queries/{searchQueryId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Users can only read and write their own search queries.
 * - Listing of all users is disallowed.
 * - No data validation is performed, focusing on rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `userProfileId` field within the `SearchQuery` documents MUST match the `userId`
 *   in the path `/users/{userId}/search_queries/{searchQueryId}`. This redundancy allows
 *   for efficient security rules without additional `get()` calls.
