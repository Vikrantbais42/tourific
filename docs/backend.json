    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to support the Tourific application's features, focusing on user profiles and search queries.  It employs path-based ownership for user profiles and their associated search queries, ensuring data isolation and simplified security rules. This structure facilitates straightforward authorization rules based solely on `request.auth.uid`, without requiring complex `get()` calls, thus ensuring Authorization Independence. The `users/{userId}/search_queries/{searchQueryId}` path directly associates search queries with user profiles and guarantees that only the authenticated user can access their own data, providing QAPs. By enforcing a clear ownership model, we avoid the need for complex filtering logic in our security rules, further simplifying the system."
